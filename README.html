    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <h3>Visual Novel Gameplay</h3>
<p>Gameplay in "Our Personal Space" is fairly straightforward. Click (or tab, or press space bar) to advance the text.  When there is a choice, select the one you want.  If you need to go back and read some of the previous text, you can scroll back and forth with the mouse wheel or use PageUp and PageDown. If you encounter text you have already read (for example, if you are playing through a second time or loading your game), you can hold down "Ctrl" to skip until you let go of that key, or until there is a choice to be made or text you have not yet seen.</p>

<h3>Life Simulation Gameplay</h3>
<p>Once you finish the introduction section of the game, each month you will have to choose what the main character focuses her attention on in three areas: Work, Skills, and Relaxation. This screen also has valuable information about the status of their marriage, the colony, the weather, etc. Your choices will affect the game in several ways:</p>
<ul><li>Choosing to work hard will help the colony more, but is more stressful than taking it easy.</li>
<li>Progressing in different skills unlocks different options in monthly events, as well as helping out the colony and meeting different people.  She will unlock more options by focusing on one or two skills than by learning a little bit of everything. </li>
<li>Choosing to relax together will help build her relationship with her husband, but it is slightly less relaxing than choosing to relax separately.</li>
<li>During events, some options will be listed in italics. These are special options that you unlocked because of your previous choices. Usually those are better than the ordinary options, but not always!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving and Loading</h3>
<p>You can save at any time by pressing "Esc" or right-clicking. Similarly, you can load your game at any time by selecting "Load Game" from this menu.  The game will auto-save at certain points, but you should make your own saves.</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>
<p>You can change the volumes, control the speed text appears, turn off transitions, etc from this screen.</p>
